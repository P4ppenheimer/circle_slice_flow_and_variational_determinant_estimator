# Circle Slice Flows and the Variational Determinant Estimator

This repository contains the codebase related to my master thesis [Circle Slice Flows and the Variational Determinant Estimator](https://github.com/P4ppenheimer/master_thesis) under supervision of [Emiel Hoogeboom](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=nkTd_BIAAAAJ&hl=en) prepared during 2020 at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). 

The thesis introduces _Circle Slice Flows_ and [_The Variational Determinant Estimator_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13311). The former is a novel type of flow which allows density estimation on the D dimensional hypersphere and the latter is a variational extension of the recently introduced determinat estimator by [Sohl-Dickstein (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06553v2) which utilizes spherical flows to model a proposal distribution for variance reduction. 

The repository contains an implementation of both and the recently introduced family of _Cylindrical Flows_ introduced by 
[Rezende et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02428). 

It is still subject to change and the readme will be extended and clarified at a later time point.
